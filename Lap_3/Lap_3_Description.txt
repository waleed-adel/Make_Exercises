A) Integrating Your Build System with Eclipse:

	- Using eclipse it is possible to integrate your own build system for a project using build option in
		the project preferences.
		
	- It is even possible to make eclipse error/warning/info parsers under stand your compiler
		error/warning/info syntax . This will give you the ability to use eclipse problems window to
		navigate through your compiler error/warning/info. This can be done using
		window/preferences/(C/C++)/build/settings.
		
	- For GNU GCC, here are examples of error/warning/info messages:
			- main.c:12:5: error: expected ',' or ';' before 'boolâ€˜
					- FileName:LineNumber:ColumnNumber: error: Description
	
			- main.c:12:5: warning: overflow in implicit constant conversion [-Woverflow]
				- FileName:LineNumber:ColumnNumber: warning: Description
				- Note: you have to add -Wall option to generate many types of warnings
	
			- main.c:14:11: note: each undeclared identifier is reported only once for each function it appears in
				- FileName:LineNumber:ColumnNumber: note: Description


B) Steps:

	1) Download our Final makefile environment from the following link.
		link: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1E4031ShvNV4qow0DWqqnOqcRPZS8vy8Q

	2) Modify our makefile to make the compiler generate warnings on all operations.

	3) In eclipse error parsers add a new error parser to under stand your compiler
		error/warning/info syntax.
		
	4) Write 3 regular expressions: 1 to parse errors, 1 to parse warnings and 1 to parse info.
